# Infracost GitHub Actions

### Try the GitHub App
ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ We recommend using the [**free Infracost GitHub App**](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/github_app/) as it's much simpler to setup and faster to run

---

This GitHub Action runs Infracost so you can see cloud cost estimates and FinOps best practices for Terraform in pull requests ðŸ’°

<img src=".github/assets/pull-request.png" alt="Example screenshot" />

## Quick start

1. If you haven't done so already, [download Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) and run `infracost auth login` to get a free API key.

2. Retrieve your Infracost API key by running `infracost configure get api_key`.

3. [Create a repo secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `INFRACOST_API_KEY` with your API key.

4. Create a new file in `.github/workflows/infracost.yml` in your repo with the following content.

```yaml
# Infracost runs on pull requests (PR) and posts PR comments.
# If you use Infracost Cloud, Infracost also runs on main/master branch pushes so the dashboard is updated.
# The GitHub Action docs (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) describe other trigger options.

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, closed]

  # the same ssh-agent socket value across all jobs & steps.

  # This stage runs the Infracost CLI and posts PR comments.
  # It also updates PR comments when the PR is updated (synchronize event).

5. Test the integration using the following steps:

    1. In your infra-as-code repo, create a new branch "infracost_test".
    2. In the test branch, add a new file called `infracost_test.tf` at the repo root with the following example Terraform code.
        <details><summary>Example AWS Terraform code</summary>

        ```hcl
        provider "aws" {
          region                      = "us-east-1"
          skip_credentials_validation = true
          skip_requesting_account_id  = true
          access_key                  = "mock_access_key"
          secret_key                  = "mock_secret_key"
        }

        resource "aws_instance" "my_web_app" {
          ami           = "ami-005e54dee72cc1d00"

          instance_type = "m3.xlarge" # <<<<<<<<<< Try changing this to m5.xlarge to compare the costs

          tags = {
            Environment = "production"
            Service     = "web-app"
          }

          root_block_device {
            volume_size = 1000 # <<<<<<<<<< Try adding volume_type="gp3" to compare costs
          }
        }

        resource "aws_lambda_function" "my_hello_world" {
          runtime       = "nodejs12.x"
          handler       = "exports.test"
          image_uri     = "test"
          function_name = "test"
          role          = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123123123123:instance/i-1231231231"

          memory_size = 512
          tags = {
            Environment = "Prod"
          }
        }
        ```

        In the above example, the Infracost pull request comment points out that:
        1. The `root_block_device` defaults to AWS `gp2` since `volume_type` has not been specified. You should consider using `gp3` as it enables you to define performance independent of storage capacity, while providing up to 20% lower price per GB.
        2. Also, the `m3` instance type is previous generation and should be upgraded to `m5` since that gives you a 27% saving for a more performant machine.

        In the above example, the Infracost pull request comment points out that:
        1. The `Standard_F16s` instance type is previous generation and should be upgraded to `Standard_F16s_v2`, since that gives you a more performant machine at a lower cost.
        2. The App Service plan SKU name should be upgraded to a v3 plan, such as `P0v3`, since that gives you more performance and is eligible for savings plans and reserved instance pricing, opening opportunities for major savings.

    3. Commit and push the change.
    4. Send a pull request from the test branch into main/master (don't worry we won't merge it!).
    5. ðŸŽ‰ That's it! You should see a pull request comment showing the cost estimate as well as FinOps best practices that could be considered.
    6. Feel free to change other things in the `infracost_test.tf` file. The pull request comment gets updated when new changes are pushed, e.g. the ðŸ“‰ and ðŸ“ˆ emojis will update when costs decrease or increase. Close the pull request when you are done testing.

6. [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) is our SaaS product that builds on top of Infracost open source. It enables team leads, managers and FinOps practitioners to setup [tagging policies](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/tagging_policies/), [guardrails](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/guardrails/) and [best practices](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/cost_policies/) to help guide the team. For example, you can check for required tag keys/values, or suggest switching AWS gp2 volumes to gp3 as they are more performant and cheaper.

    If you **do not** want to use [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io), go to Org Settings and disable the dashboard. This causes the CLI not to send its JSON output to your dashboard; the JSON does not contain any cloud credentials or secrets, see the [FAQ](https://infracost.io/docs/faq/) for more information.

    <img src=".github/assets/infracost-cloud-dashboard.png" alt="Infracost Cloud enables you to check for best practices such as using latest generation instance types or block storage, as well as setup tagging policies and guardrails to help guide the team." />

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, check the GitHub Action logs and the following steps. You can also join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„

### Permissions issue

If you receive an error when running the `infracost comment` command in your pipeline, it's probably related to `${{ github.token }}`. This is the default GitHub token available to actions and is used to post comments. The default [token permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) are read-only by default and `pull-requests: write` is required. If you are using SAML single sign-on, you must first [authorize the token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

#### The `add GIT_SSH_KEY` step fails

If you are using private modules and receive a `option requires an argument -- a` error in the `add GIT_SSH_KEY` step:
1. Make sure you have the following set in your workflow `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`:
    ```yml
    env:
      SSH_AUTH_SOCK: /tmp/ssh_agent.sock
    ```
2. Try changing the `ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK` line to the following:
    ```yml
    ssh-agent -a "${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }}"
    ```
