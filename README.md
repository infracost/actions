# Infracost GitHub Actions

### Try the GitHub App
ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ We recommend using the [**free Infracost GitHub App**](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/github_app/) as it's much simpler to setup and faster to run

---

This GitHub Action runs Infracost so you can see cloud cost estimates and FinOps best practices for Terraform in pull requests ðŸ’°

## Quick start

1. If you haven't done so already, [download Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) and run `infracost auth login` to get a free API key.

2. Retrieve your Infracost API key by running `infracost configure get api_key`.

3. [Create a repo secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `INFRACOST_API_KEY` with your API key.

4. Create a new file in `.github/workflows/infracost.yml` in your repo with the following content.

```yaml
# Infracost runs on pull requests (PR) and posts PR comments.
# If you use Infracost Cloud, Infracost also runs on main/master branch pushes so the dashboard is updated.
# The GitHub Action docs (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) describe other trigger options.
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, closed]
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

env:
  # If you use private modules you'll need this env variable to use
  # the same ssh-agent socket value across all jobs & steps.
  SSH_AUTH_SOCK: /tmp/ssh_agent.sock
jobs:
  # This stage runs the Infracost CLI and posts PR comments.
  # It also updates PR comments when the PR is updated (synchronize event).

5. Follow [these simple steps](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/get_started/#4-send-a-pull-request) to test the integration. This is important as it ensures the CLI commands are running correctly in your workflow ðŸ‘Œ

6. [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) is our SaaS product that builds on top of Infracost open source. It enables team leads, managers and FinOps practitioners to setup [tagging policies](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/tagging_policies/), [guardrails](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/guardrails/) and [best practices](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/cost_policies/) to help guide the team. For example, you can check for required tag keys/values, or suggest switching AWS gp2 volumes to gp3 as they are more performant and cheaper.

    If you **do not** want to use [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io), go to Org Settings and disable the dashboard. This causes the CLI not to send its JSON output to your dashboard; the JSON does not contain any cloud credentials or secrets, see the [FAQ](https://infracost.io/docs/faq/) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, check the GitHub Action logs and the following steps. You can also join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„

### Permissions issue

If you receive an error when running the `infracost comment` command in your pipeline, it's probably related to `${{ github.token }}`. This is the default GitHub token available to actions and is used to post comments. The default [token permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) are read-only by default and `pull-requests: write` is required. If you are using SAML single sign-on, you must first [authorize the token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

#### The `add GIT_SSH_KEY` step fails

If you are using private modules and receive a `option requires an argument -- a` error in the `add GIT_SSH_KEY` step:
1. Make sure you have the following set in your workflow `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`:
    ```yml
    env:
      SSH_AUTH_SOCK: /tmp/ssh_agent.sock
    ```
2. Try changing the `ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK` line to the following:
    ```yml
    ssh-agent -a "${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }}"
    ```
