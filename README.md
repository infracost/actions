# Infracost GitHub Actions

This project provide a GitHub Action and examples for Infracost, so you can see cloud cost estimates for Terraform in pull requests ðŸ’°

<img src=".github/assets/screenshot.png" alt="Example screenshot" />

## Quick start

The following steps assume a simple Terraform directory is being used, we recommend you use a more relevant [example](#examples) if required.

1. If you haven't done so already, [download Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) and run `infracost auth login` to get a free API key.

2. Retrieve your Infracost API key by running `infracost configure get api_key`.

3. [Create a repo secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `INFRACOST_API_KEY` with your API key.

4. Create a new file in `.github/workflows/infracost.yml` in your repo with the following content.

```yaml
# The GitHub Actions docs (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)
# describe other options for 'on'. This examples generates the cost baseline on pushes to main/master branches and
# the cost diff and comment on pushes to the pull request branch.
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
env:
  # If you use private modules you'll need this env variable to use
  # the same ssh-agent socket value across all jobs & steps.
  SSH_AUTH_SOCK: /tmp/ssh_agent.sock
jobs:
  infracost:
    name: Infracost
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      TF_ROOT: examples/terraform-project/code
      # This instructs the CLI to send cost estimates to Infracost Cloud. Our SaaS product
      #   complements the open source CLI by giving teams advanced visibility and controls.
      #   The cost estimates are transmitted in JSON format and do not contain any cloud
      #   credentials or secrets (see https://infracost.io/docs/faq/ for more information).
      INFRACOST_ENABLE_CLOUD: true
      # If you're using Terraform Cloud/Enterprise and have variables or private modules stored
      # on there, specify the following to automatically retrieve the variables:
      #   INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TFC_TOKEN }}
      #   INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_CLOUD_HOST: app.terraform.io # Change this if you're using Terraform Enterprise

    steps:
      # If you use private modules, add an environment variable or secret
      # called GIT_SSH_KEY with your private key, so Infracost can access
      # private repositories (similar to how Terraform/Terragrunt does).

```

4. ðŸŽ‰ That's it! Send a new pull request to change something in Terraform that costs money. You should see a pull request comment that gets updated, e.g. the ðŸ“‰ and ðŸ“ˆ emojis will update as changes are pushed!

    If there are issues, check the GitHub Actions logs and [this page](https://www.infracost.io/docs/troubleshooting/).

5. To see pull request costs in Infracost Cloud, [log in](https://dashboard.infracost.io/) > switch to your organization > Projects. To learn more, see [our docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/infracost_cloud/get_started/).

    <img src=".github/assets/infracost-cloud-runs.png" alt="Infracost Cloud gives team leads, managers and FinOps practitioners visibility across all cost estimates in CI/CD" width="90%" />

6. Follow [the docs](https://www.infracost.io/usage-file) if you'd also like to show cost for of usage-based resources such as AWS Lambda or S3. The usage for these resources are fetched from CloudWatch/cloud APIs and used to calculate an estimate.

### Troubleshooting

#### Permissions issue

If you receive an error when running the `infracost comment` command in your pipeline, it's probably related to `${{ github.token }}`. This is the default GitHub token available to actions and is used to post comments. The default [token permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) work fine but `pull-requests: write` is required if you need to customize these. If you are using SAML single sign-on, you must first [authorize the token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

#### The `add GIT_SSH_KEY` step fails

If you are using private modules and receive a `option requires an argument -- a` error in the `add GIT_SSH_KEY` step:
1. Make sure you have the following set in your workflow `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`:
    ```yml
    env:
      SSH_AUTH_SOCK: /tmp/ssh_agent.sock
    ```
2. Try changing the `ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK` line to the following:
    ```yml
    ssh-agent -a "${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }}"
    ```

## Examples

The [examples](examples) directory demonstrates how these actions can be used for different projects. They all work by using the default Infracost CLI option that parses HCL, thus a Terraform plan JSON is not needed.
  - [Terraform/Terragrunt projects (single or multi)](examples/terraform-project): a repository containing one or more (e.g. mono repos) Terraform or Terragrunt projects
  - [Multi-projects using a config file](examples/multi-project-config-file): repository containing multiple Terraform projects that need different inputs, i.e. variable files or Terraform workspaces
  - [Slack](examples/slack): send cost estimates to Slack

For advanced use cases where the estimate needs to be generated from Terraform plan JSON files, see the [plan JSON examples here](examples#plan-json-examples).

### Cost policies

Infracost policies enable centralized teams, who are often helping others with cloud costs, to provide advice before resources are launched, setup guardrails, and prevent human error. Follow [our docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cost_policies/) to use Infracost's native support for Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies. This enables you to see passing/failing policies in Infracost pull request comments (shown below) without having to install anything else.

![](.github/assets/policy-passing-github.png)

If you use HashiCorp Sentinel, follow [our example](examples/sentinel) to output the policy pass/fail results into CI/CD logs.
