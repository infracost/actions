# Infracost GitHub Actions

This project provides a set of GitHub Actions for Infracost, so you can see cloud cost estimates for Terraform in pull requests ðŸ’°

<img src=".github/assets/screenshot.png" alt="Example screenshot" />

## Quick start

The following steps assume a simple Terraform directory is being used, we recommend you use a more relevant [example](#examples) if required.

1. Retrieve your Infracost API key by running `infracost configure get api_key`. We recommend using your same API key in all environments. If you don't have one, [download Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) and run `infracost register` to get a free API key.

2. [Create a repo secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `INFRACOST_API_KEY` with your API key.

3. Create required repo secrets for any cloud credentials that are needed for Terraform to run. If you have multiple projects/workspaces, consider using an Infracost [config-file](https://www.infracost.io/docs/multi_project/config_file) to define the projects.

    - **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise users**: if you use Remote Execution Mode, you should follow [setup-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) instructions to set the inputs `cli_config_credentials_token`, and `cli_config_credentials_hostname` for Terraform Enterprise.
    - **AWS users**: use [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials), the [Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables) explain other options.
    - **Azure users**: the [Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/service_principal_client_secret) explain the options. The [Azure/login](https://github.com/Azure/login) GitHub Actions might also be useful; we haven't tested these with Terraform.
    - **Google users**: the [Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#full-reference) explain the options, e.g. using `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`.

4. Create a new file in `.github/workflows/infracost.yml` in your repo with the following content.

 ```yaml
    # The GitHub Actions docs (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)
    # describe other options for 'on', 'pull_request' is a good default.
    on: [pull_request]
    jobs:
      terraform-directory:
        name: Terraform directory
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

          steps:
            # Checkout the branch you want Infracost to compare costs against. This example is using the
            # target PR branch.
            - name: Checkout base branch
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
              with:
                ref: '${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}'

            - name: Setup Infracost
              uses: infracost/actions/setup@v2
              with:
                api-key: ${{ secrets.INFRACOST_API_KEY }}

            # Generate an Infracost output JSON from the comparison branch, so that Infracost can compare the cost difference.
            - name: Generate Infracost cost snapshot
              run: |
                infracost breakdown --path examples/terraform-directory/code \
                                    --format json \
                                    --out-file /tmp/prior.json

            - name: Run Infracost
              run: |
                infracost diff --path examples/terraform-directory/code \
                                    --format json \
                                    --compare-to /tmp/prior.json \
                                    --out-file /tmp/infracost.json

            - name: Post Infracost comment
              run: |
                  # Posts a comment to the PR using the 'update' behavior.
                  # This creates a single comment and updates it. The "quietest" option.
                  # The other valid behaviors are:
                  #   delete-and-new - Delete previous comments and create a new one.
                  #   hide-and-new - Minimize previous comments and create a new one.
                  #   new - Create a new cost estimate comment on every push.
                  # See https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests for other options.
                  infracost comment github --path /tmp/infracost.json \
                                           --repo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY \
                                           --github-token ${{github.token}} \
                                           --pull-request ${{github.event.pull_request.number}} \
                                           --behavior update
 ```

5. ðŸŽ‰ That's it! Send a new pull request to change something in Terraform that costs money. You should see a pull request comment that gets updated, e.g. the ðŸ“‰ and ðŸ“ˆ emojis will update as changes are pushed!

    If there are issues, check the GitHub Actions logs and [this page](https://www.infracost.io/docs/troubleshooting/).

6. Follow [the docs](https://www.infracost.io/usage-file) if you'd also like to show cost for of usage-based resources such as AWS Lambda or S3. The usage for these resources are fetched from CloudWatch/cloud APIs and used to calculate an estimate.

## Examples

The [examples](examples) directory demonstrates how these actions can be used in different workflows, including:
  - [Terraform directory](examples/terraform-directory): a Terraform directory containing HCL code
  - [Terraform plan JSON](examples/terraform-plan-json): a Terraform plan JSON file
  - [Terragrunt](examples/terragrunt): a Terragrunt project
  - [Terraform Cloud/Enterprise](examples/terraform-cloud-enterprise): a Terraform project using Terraform Cloud/Enterprise
  - [Multi-project using config file](examples/multi-project/README.md#using-an-infracost-config-file): multiple Terraform projects using the Infracost [config file](https://www.infracost.io/docs/multi_project/config_file)
  - [Multi-project using build matrix](examples/multi-project/README.md#using-github-actions-build-matrix): multiple Terraform projects using GitHub Actions build matrix
  - [Multi-Terraform workspace](examples/multi-terraform-workspace): multiple Terraform workspaces using the Infracost [config file](https://www.infracost.io/docs/multi_project/config_file)
  - [Private Terraform module](examples/private-terraform-module): a Terraform project using a private Terraform module
  - [Slack](examples/slack): [send cost estimates to Slack](examples/slack)

### Cost policies

Infracost policies enable centralized teams, who are often helping others with cloud costs, to provide advice before resources are launched, setup guardrails, and prevent human error. Follow [our docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cost_policies/) to use Infracost's native support for Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies. This enables you to see passing/failing policies in Infracost pull request comments (shown below) without having to install anything else.

If you use HashiCorp Sentinel, follow [our example](examples/sentinel) to output the policy pass/fail results into CI/CD logs.

## Actions

We recommend you use the above [quick start](#quick-start) guide and examples, which uses the [setup](setup) action. This downloads and installs the Infracost CLI in your GitHub Actions workflow.
